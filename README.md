### Hi there 👋 I'm Michael

I'm a student at the University of Warwick, I love coding and statistics.

Do check out my [4D Tic Tac Toe](https://www.4dtictactoe.com) game!

Right now my main private project is [Ripple](https://www.rippleit.co.uk). Sign up to claim your username!

Warwick does not allow public posting of their coursework submissions, so amongst public repos, I also have the following University projects available on request:

Multithreaded C suspicious network analyser, Java advanced SQL data input and query system, Twitter clone with efficient data structures, Scratch clone built in Haskell, Haskell Mastermind game solver, Python min cost scheduling with constraints, Prolog satsifiability solver, redesigned mini C compiler LLVM front end, MapReduce data analysis, Iris dataset PCA/High dimensional Kernel/Linear Classifier, implementation and performance evaluation of a [fused data structure](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~garg/dist/tpds12.pdf) for fault tolerance, derivative trade input/viewer with machine learning erroneous input detection.
